    "* Based on the data, overall students are better at math than reading. This is because the average reading score is higher than the average math score, and the percentage of students passing reading is higher than the percentage of student passing math. The data also shows that Charter school students may perform better than District schools because all 5 of the highest performing schools were Charter schools, and all 5 of the lowest performing schools were District schools. However, the data collected only measures math and reading, not other areas such as science, and art. We can also conclude that budget has no bearing on student success, as the highest performing schools and lowest performing schools had similar budgets. "
